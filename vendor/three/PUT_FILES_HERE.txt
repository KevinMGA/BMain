Copy Three.js ESM files here if you don't already have them:

/vendor/three/build/three.module.js
/vendor/three/examples/jsm/loaders/FBXLoader.js
/vendor/three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js

You can grab them from a local three.js install (node_modules/three/build + examples/jsm).

This project uses an <importmap> in index.html to resolve 'three'.
